# HabitTracker
Flutter app for tracking personal habits. It lets the user create habits, tasks and events. This app was created as my final project at LBS Eibiswald and was my first complete Flutter app that I built. It uses an SQLite database to store the habit data.

There are definitely things to improve and I didn't follow a lot of best practices when it comes to Flutter development for this project but as it was my first experience with Flutter I mostly saw this as a learning experience. I currently have no intention to continue working on this specific app.
